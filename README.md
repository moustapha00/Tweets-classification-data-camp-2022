* II Introduction

Twitter sentiment analysis is the method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the sentiment behind the tweet whether a piece of written text(tweet) is positive, neutral or negative.

The goal is using machine learning techniques and natural language processing to extract the subjective information of a document and try to classify it according to its polarity such as positive, neutral or negative. In real life, Sentiment analysis is very important, for example, in business analytics data is mined for patterns that would help better understand customers, and improve sales and marketing. Also, sentiment analysis brings together various research areas such as natural language
processing, data mining and text mining, and is fast becoming of major importance to organizations as they strive to integrate computational intelligence methods into their operations, and attempts to shed more light on, and improve, their products
and services.

 In this project, we analyze the sentiments behind the twitter’s tweet. Those refers to the people felling  about apple produce.  We have three type of sentiment:
Positive, Neutral and Negative.
